# Healthcare Call Scheduling Optimization Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to optimize call scheduling in a healthcare contact center environment by analyzing the impact of various factors like time of day, day of the week, and demographics on call success rates. The objective is to enhance operational efficiency and improve member satisfaction through strategic scheduling based on data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement
The timing of outbound calls significantly affects success rates in healthcare contact centers. Optimal call timing, considering factors such as member demographics and daily patterns, remains a challenge. This project explores this aspect by determining the best time slots for placing calls to maximize success rates.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards that visualize call success trends and demographic insights.
- **Power Query**: Used for data preprocessing and cleaning within Power BI.
- **CSV Datasets**: Raw data in CSV format used for analysis.

## Repository Contents
- **Demographic_Data.csv**: Contains demographic information related to the call recipients.
- **Hackathon_Call_Log_Data.csv**: Includes logs of call attempts with outcomes.
- **Team Knights PowerBI dashboard.pbix**: Interactive dashboard developed in Power BI for visualizing key insights and analytics.

## Dashboard Overview
The final dashboard provides visualizations of:
- Call success rates across different times of the day and days of the week.
- Correlation between demographic factors and call success.
- Detailed analysis of unsuccessful call attempts, including reasons for failures.

## Key Insights
- Late afternoon and evening are the most effective times for successful calls.
- Weekends show lower success rates compared to weekdays.
- Demographic factors play a significant role in determining optimal call timing.
